# The Prestige

Today I learned that the movie, [The Prestige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtaA9fFNXU) is based on a book, __The Prestige__ by Christopher Priest. The book is not too dissimilar from the movie,but it is definitely more science-fiction and historical fiction than the movie.
Seems like an interesting book to read, adding it to the list.

# Palestine

I read an interesting article today in [The New Left Review](https://newleftreview.org) called [The House of Zion](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii96/articles/perry-anderson-the-house-of-zion) by Penny Anderson.
In it, she details the conflict from a framing of its failures -- why did the two-state solution fail? What were the blockers for the Palestinians from taking a deal? What was the history pre-Nakba?
I found it very informative for the failure of a two-state solution, and the non-starter of a one-state solution, and the enduring result. She also discusses the frustration with governments of the Palestinian Authority, where they were essentially a puppet state with no real authority -- the IDF/Shin Bet controls the real security, and the PA does nothing as they take more and more land. The economic conditions are also described, with a few people at the top of the PA taking all the money and influence while the rest of Palestine grows poorer and more destitute (and destroyed by settlers).

The idea, then, is unresolved -- the status quo will continue until ethnic cleansing (right now) or genocide, or forced removal (all things that we thought were a non-starter in Modernism).

# B.O.B.

Listening to Airplanes, Pt 1 by B.o.B.

[Airplanes, Pt. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU)

This part really got to me:

```text
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But, nowadays, we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days (Days)
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decaturâ€”what's up, Bobby Ray?
So, can I get a wish to end the politics? (Oh)
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand, and then again, I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
```

Just a hope of nostalgia to when we were growing up and didn't have the pressure of producers, parents, or whoever.
