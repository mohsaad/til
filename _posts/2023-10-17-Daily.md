# Heartwork

Some notes from the rest of the Heartwork podcast:

- Your children’s eyes will teach them more than your lips ever will.
- It’s very hard to change yourself suddenly. You really have to do it over time.
  - Be very methodical and take it slow. Don't rush into trying to do everything.
- The eyes and the ears are the quickest route to the heart. Be very cautious with them.

# Prefix Sums

I always knew what this was, but didn't know the technical term for it.

A prefix sum is the sum of all values up to the and including the current index. So, for example, this
is how we'd compute the prefix sum of a list in python:

```python
def prefix_sum(w: List[int]) -> List[int]:
  for idx in range(1, len(w)):
    w[idx] += w[idx - 1]

  return w
```

# Auto-Merge

This is a library that automatically merges events or changes to a system. The way it works is by having the events expressed in such a way
that there's only one way to order them correctly. This is used in collaborative editors and other real-time applications.

Library for posterity: [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge)

# Strawberry Library

FastAPI apparently works really well with [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks). I have to do a bit more digging but it should be a good start.
